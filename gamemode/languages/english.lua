HORDE Translation Guideline
1. Use English as base.
2. Do NOT translate special characters. e.g. {1}, %d. Keep those directly.
3. Keep translations short and concise.
4. Consistency, especially for perks.
increase vs. more: these two descriptions are DIFFERENT!
resistance vs. less damage taken: same as above.
5. Translate AS IS.
6. Convar translate is in resource\localization\(your language)\horde.properties
7. Valid languages (from gmod's menu): bg cs da de el en en-PT es-ES et fi fr ga-IE he hr hu it ja ko lt nl no pl pt-BR pt-PT ru sk sv-SE th tr uk vi zh-CN zh-TW
